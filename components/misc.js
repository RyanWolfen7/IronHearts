            <ul>As ships clash, with all their might.</ul>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <ul>So let the war rage on, in the endless night,</ul>
            <ul>A battle for freedom, a valiant fight,</ul>
            <ul>For in this void, they shall not surrender,</ul>
            <ul>Their spirit of rebellion, an eternal contender </ul> */}

              // 57 year old man named John. He was 15 when he faught against the Federation on mars. He quickly made hiself a hero with his fearlessness and was the heart of the mars rebellion. Unfortionately the federation overwhelmed the rebels and they where masacred. the survivors, including john, where onscripted as miners. They brought a moon sized astroid out of orbit and established liberty mining colony. John has nightmares of his battles, but he has a keen understanding of himself and thinks objectively about those times. In his heart he wants to see Liberty Mining Colony free from the federation, but he worries his friends (General Mavernic and Sargent Major Agetha) are blinded by past glory. Whats worse is his son is the wing commander of the space force and leading the charge against the oncoming federation cruisers. He sees and understands both sides of the conflict, he is almost certain his friends and son will die, but its not his fight. He is the chief mechanic and he has a responsibility to keep the mining operations running.
              // John's son is the wing commander of the Liberty Mining Colony's space force, leading the charge against the incoming Federation cruisers. Despite his father's objections, the younger generation of miners are eager to fight and defend their home. John sees the same fearlessness in them that he once had, but he also understands the heavy toll of war. He doesn't want to see any more bloodshed, but he knows he can't stop the inevitable. He will do his best to mentor and support the younger miners, hoping they will find a way to peacefully coexist with the Federation, rather than resorting to violence.
