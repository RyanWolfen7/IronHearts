                <p>Iron Hearts is a mix of Mash, Mobile Suit Gundam, and Game of Thrones with themes of the American Revolution. It is a tale of humanity in all of its glory, compassion, and horror. Told from the perspective of both sides of the conflict, the lines between wright and wrong, truth and lies, and the very notion of "Enemy" become blurred.</p><br/>
                <p>For over 300 years, Earth has been globalized and has expanded into space. As humanity grew in numbers and resources became scarce, the Earth Federation established colonies outside of Earth's sphere to address the pressing need for raw materials. The colonies provided the necessary resources that were scarce on our homeworld, while the Earth Federation maintained control over the food supply. However, as the colonies grew and developed their own unique identities and cultures, the cohesiveness and unity of humanity began to diminish.</p><br/>
                {/* <p>Gama 3 was a penal colony for conscripted Mars rebels that mined essential raw minerals. After 20 years, the conscripts were freed, but the colony's productivity declined due to strong solar winds. The Earth Federation responded by limiting food shipments, increasing tensions. With many former rebels among them, the colony renamed itself to Liberty, declared independence and stopped all shipments. Now, the Federation is sending battleships to reclaim their assets, and Liberty is preparing to defend themselves.</p><br/> */}
                <p>Gama 3, once a penal colony for conscripted Mars rebels, was established by redirecting an asteroid's orbit to provide Earth with essential raw and rare minerals. After 20 years, the conscripts had served their sentences and were freed. However, the colony's productivity was hampered by strong solar winds, causing them to miss numerous quotas. As a result, the Earth Federation began to restrict food shipments to the colony, exacerbating existing tensions. Given that many of the colonists were originally conscripted from a failed Mars rebellion, Liberty declared its independence and ceased all shipments to Earth. Now, a year has passed since the strike began, and the Earth Federation has sent three advanced battleships to reclaim its assets. In preparation for the invasion, the Liberty colonists have been fortifying their colony and improvising weapons to defend themselves.</p><br/>

When you have things to do in front of you, you can't waste time worrying about what might come. I've been there, fought hard for what I believed in, and lost. It's not easy, and it's not something you can forget. But you gotta keep going, keep living, and keep doing what needs to be done. Your duty is to the present, not to the past or the future. You wanna be a warrior? Fine, but remember that your responsibility is not just to fight, but to live and to build something worth fighting for. Don't forget that."
