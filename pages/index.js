                <p>Iron Hearsts is a mix of Mash, Mobile Suit Gundam, and Game of Thrones with themes of the American Revolution.</p><br/>
                <p>It is a tale of humanity in all of its glory, compassion, and horror. Told from the perspective of both sides of the conflict, the lines between wright and wrong, truth and lies, and the very notion of "Enemy" become blurred.</p><br/>
                <p>It has been over 300 years since Earth Globalized and began its venture into space. However the further Huanity expanded the less cohesive our unity bacame. In an attempt to keep order the Earth Federation maintained a monopoly on food and in response the colonies it established outside the earth sphere would provide raw reasourses long gone from our homeworld.</p><br/>
                <p>One such colony is Gama 3, self proclaimed as Liberty Mining Colony, was a penal colony established by pulling an astroid out of orbit. It was Earths largest supplier of raw and rare minerals until strong solar winds dampened collection. After countless missed quotas the Earth Federation began limiting thier shipments of food to Liberty. As many colonists where origionally conscripts from a failed Mars rebellion, Liberty declared independance and ceased all shipments to Earth.</p><br/>
                <p>One year has passed since Liberty Mining Colony went on strike. The Federation have sent 3 state of the art battle ships to reclaim thier assets. In preperation the the Liberty Colonists begin improvising arms and armaments to fortifying thier home to impeding invasion.</p>

                "The fight between us and the Earth Federation is not just about resources, but about our right to live free and with dignity. We will not let them control us and oppress our people. This is a battle for our independence and the future of our colony. We will stand firm and fight for our cause, for we are the defenders of our own destiny."                <br/><span> - General Mavernic LMCF </span>

                "The Liberty Mining Colony rebels have been a regrettable consequence of our investment in their society. We provided the resources and support necessary for their growth, yet they failed to meet their obligations to the Earth Federation. This left us with no choice but to take action to protect our interests and maintain the delicate balance of power in the solar system. The rebels must understand that their actions have consequences, and we will not hesitate to use our military might to uphold our authority."                <br/><span> - General Holton EFSF </span>

                "Young blood, listen up. War is a bitter pill to swallow, and you can't afford to be blinded by its glory. When you have things to do in front of you, you can't waste time worrying about what might come. I've been there, fought hard for what I believed in, and lost. It's not easy, and it's not something you can forget. But you gotta keep going, keep living, and keep doing what needs to be done. Your duty is to the present, not to the past or the future. You wanna be a warrior? Fine, but remember that your responsibility is not just to fight, but to live and to build something worth fighting for. Don't forget that."
